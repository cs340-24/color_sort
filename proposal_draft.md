## Introduction
### What is Color Sort?
Color Sort is a puzzle game that starts with blocks of various colors shuffled up in bottles. You are given 1 empty bottle if there are 2 or 3 colors to be sorted and 2 empty bottles if there are 4+ colors.<br>

The objective of the game is to sort all of the colors so that all blocks of the same color are in the same bottle.

### Motivation
Our goal is to create a mobile app implementing a Color Sorting game with the following features:
* Ability to reset levels
* Ability to undo moves
* Save user's progress when they leave the app
* Options for increasing/decreasing difficulty level

### Market Context
Color Sort is a classic puzzle game, and there are a variety of Color Sorting games already available on the Google Play store. Unfortunately, most of these contain a gratuitous number of ads. Some of the apps that charge a fee for ad-free play will still require adds for certain features such as undoing moves or resetting levels. <br>
Existing Color Sorting apps often lack the ability to customize the difficulty level of the game. 

## section 2: customer value
* The project from the customer's perspective is simply a puzzle game that increments in difficulty the longer the user plays the game and progresses. It is a form of entertainment and fun for the customer, providing an experience to entertain and possibly strengthen the mind of the customer as well.

### What need does it fill
* The project fulfills the need for the customer's entertainment and time consumption.

### Who is customer and what do they want
* The customer is anyone tech-savvy enough to download games off of the Google Play or App Store coupled with people interested in and entertained by puzzle games. The customer wants a way to entertain themselves and challenge themselves with puzzles as well.

### How will customer benefit
* The customer, interested in entertainment and a challenge, will benefit from this app because this app provides a free and easily accessible way for the user to entertain themselves since the app is simple and doesn't need to use internet.

### Does it provide new capabilities or improvements for customer
* The app does not provide new capabilites, there are countless other puzzle games available on mobile marketplaces but the app provides the improvement of not needing internet access, as many apps currently require your device to be online. Another improvment is the fact that the app will not contain advertisements, which are an annoyance and take away from the experience of a game.

### Customer-centric measures of success
* Success will be defined by two chief measures by the customer. The first measure of success is the consumer's attitude towards the amount of fun they have playing the game. If the player doesn't have any fun in playing the game, then there's really no point in making the game available to play in the first place. The second measure of success is the customer's readiness to continue playing the game. If the game doesn't have any staying power, or if the player gets bored very quickly, then the game won't have any staying power in any financial market of success, even if the app isn't meant for making money.

### How will we know if customers got benefits we wanted to provide
* We will know if the customers got the benefits we wanted to provide if the customer is entertained for a sustained period of time by our game and if the customer exhibits satisfaction at solving the game's puzzles.
