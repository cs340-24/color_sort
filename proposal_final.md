## Introduction
### What is Color Sort?
Color Sort is a puzzle game that starts with blocks of various colors shuffled up in bottles. You are given 1 empty bottle if there are 2 or 3 colors to be sorted and 2 empty bottles if there are 4+ colors.<br>

The objective of the game is to sort all of the colors so that all blocks of the same color are in the same bottle.

### Example Game with 2 colors:

### Market Context
Color Sort is a classic puzzle game, and there are a variety of Color Sorting games already available on the Google Play store. Unfortunately, most of these contain a gratuitous number of ads. Some of the apps that charge a fee for ad-free play will still require adds for certain features such as undoing moves or resetting levels. <br>
Additionally, many existing color sorting game apps don't allow the user to customize the difficulty level.

### Motivation
Our goal is to build a Color Sort mobile app this is fun to play, easy to use, and offers full functionality with no ads. 

### Planned Features
* Ability to reset levels
* Ability to undo moves
* Save user's progress when they leave the app
* Options for customizing the difficulty level
* Levels that offer additional challenges, such as:
    * Initially hiding some colors from the user
    * Limiting the number of moves that can made to complete the level
    * Setting a timer to challenge the user to complete levels within a set amount of time

## Customer Value
### Who is Our Customer and What Do They Want?
Our customer is person that owns a smartphone, has access to the Google Play or Apple App Store, and is seeking a fun, easy to learn, and mentally stimulating puzzle game that can be played on the go.

### What Benefits Does Color Sort Provide? What Needs Does it Fullfill?
The primary benefit that Color Sort offers to the customer is entertainment. <br>

Another benefit is low barrier of entry and accessibility to a wide range of people. Color Sort is an intuitive game with simple controls, making it easy to learn and play. <br> 

To add to the ease of use, the game will not require an internet connection to play. Additionally, the app will contain no ads, which are a frustrating annoyance that often detract from the experience of mobile games. 

Since Color Sort is a mobile app and individual levels can be played pretty quickly, it is a great way to fill your time when you have a few minutes to kill here and there as you go about your day.  <br>

For customers seeking a mental challenge, we aim to add the option to play levels with a higher number of colors and extra challenges, such as initially hiding some of the colors to make the puzzle more difficult, adding a timer, and limiting the number of moves that can be made to solve a puzzle. <br>

Color Sort is an ideal game for those that find the activity of sorting to be satisfying and relaxing. <br>

### Measuring Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction can be measured by allowing them to rate and review the game on the app store. We can also provide an email to which customers can send feedback, suggestions, complaints, and bug reports. 


## Proposed Solution and Technology
### Required Tools
 - Godot Game Engine
 - C++  (in order to generate level .txt files)

### Minimal Viable System Requirements:
The minimal sysem, at its base case, will generate a playable level in which the game generates a level based on a given .txt. <br>

A move function will be implemented allowing the user to move the different blocks between bottles, and a rudimentary save function will be attached to the move function's script that rewrites the generated .txt to update the new position of the block, so that if the user closes the application before completing a level, upon reopening the application, the user's previous position will be restored. Upon successfully sorting the blocks into bottles, the game will show a victory screen before generating a new level.

### System Description:
This game will, using a .txt file generated by a linked program, instance N bottle scenes their child scenes of N different colored blocks in a game level, with N and the number of blocks instanced being specified by the .txt file read.<br> 

Upon level generation, using a move script activated by a screen touch, the user will be prompted to sort the different color blocks into any bottle, until each bottle contains blocks of one sole color.<br> 

Depending on the difficulty selected, the map generation program will read in different parameters from a pre-defined instruction set, such as a smaller / larger number of colors for blocks, more / less blocks, etc. <br>

In addition, this program will save the user's place upon moving, allowing the user to leave and re-enter the application at the same move they left on and revert to previously made moves, with a final "save" system to be determined. Upon completion of a level, a new level will be generated from the same set of instructions the user previously chose based on the difficulty. From the home screen, the user will be able to change difficulties as they please.

### System Components:
-  Level Generation
    - The program will generate a level based on a given instruction set and output this instruction set to a .txt file
    - From this text file, X number of bottles and colors, and Y number of blocks will populate the screen
-  Difficulty selection
    - Acts as a config for the level generator
    - Based on the difficulty selected, the level generator will add more or less colors and blocks to the level generation's config
- Move function
    - Selecting the top block from the bottle, the user will be able to choose which bottle to move the block to
- Save function
    - Allows the user to save their last move in a level in order to return to at a later time.
    - Initially will be implemented by writing to the level's .txt used to generate the level upon entering the game
    - Will allow the user to revert to previously made moves
    - Planned to be attached to the move function, to create a save on moves

### Testing:
- Level Generation testing
    - Ensure a functional upper and lower limit for # of block colors, # of blocks, and bottles
    - Ensure a functional check that a level generation .txt is operational
-  Difficulty Selection
    - Ensure the instruction set used to generate a level is reflected by the difficulty setting selected IE the difficulty setting changes which instruction set is used
- Move Function
    - Check that any illegal moves cannot be made such as placing a block outside a bottle, moving a bottle itself, or moving a block that isnt on the top of the stack in a bottle.
- Save function
    - Ensure the "board" positions are saved upon each move
    - Ensure at the start of a new game, if the game is restarted, the loaded board is the newly generated level instead of the previous move of the preceding level.
    - Ensure functionality of reverting moves, making sure that the furthest back one can revert is the beginning of the level
- Win Condition
    - Ensure the game correctly displays a victory message upon sorting all blocks.

### Possible Improvements and Additional Features
- Implement Gamemodes
    - 1-100 levels of progressively increasing difficulty
    - Timed: Try and solve as many puzzles as possible in a timeframe
    - Endless: Generates new levels endlessly upon solving the puzzle.
    - Limited Moves: Based on the difficulty, have a certain # of moves before having to restart the level.
- Improved visuals:
    - Animations when the user selects bottles and transfers colors
    - Visual cue when the user tries to make an invalid move



## Team 
### Members:
* Coleman Oates 
* Logan Lett 
* Landon Boone
* Shanna Wallace  

### Prior Experience:
We all have little to no experience with mobile app development, so this is a new challenge for all of us. <br>

Boone has experience using Godot 3.5 and GDScript to develop games for other platforms. <br>

Shanna has written some basic Color Sort gameplay code in C++ that could potentially be used as a starting point for building the app.

### Member Roles
For the initial set-up phase, since Boone has prior experience with Godot, he will take the lead on beginning the mobile app development process.  <br>

Shanna will be adding improvements to the C++ game code. <br>

Logan and Coleman will begin visual design of the app by choosing a color palette, figuring out the optimal way to display up to 14 bottles on a small phone screen, as well as buttons or a menu for additional features, and creating a sketch or diagram of our planned game display. <br>

Once Shanna, Logan, and Coleman have gotten up to speed with Godot, we plan to split up tasks and assign them weekly or bi-weekly. <br>

As of now, we are not planning to have set roles. 

## Project Management
### Constraints
* We do not anticipate encountering any ethical, legal, or regulatory constraints. 

### Descoping Plan
If we are unable to implement the full range of features we desire, such as saving progress, undoing moves, or adding additional challenges, we plan to build an app that will at least support basic gameplay with up to 12 colors.

### Team meetings
We plan to meet once a week on Monday afternoons
