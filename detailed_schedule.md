## Weekly Timeline:
### 2/26 - 3/3
**GOALS:**
1. Write status report 1
2. Read input file and successfully load 1 level with correct colors (3 colors 4 bottles)
   * **Shanna:** Read and parse input file strings into arrays and put the arrays in a list. check each level array for errors. pop 1st level off list and extract the data from it to initialize the level
   * **Boone:** Keep working on getting the main program set up  
3. Start implementing game play functions:
   * **Coleman:** Work on the undo function. Keep looking into animation for the nodes when bottles are selected/colors transfered
   * **Logan:** Create the undo, make move, and reset level functions and maybe just have them print some kind of alert like "undoing move" for now when bottons are pressed, so we can check that the buttons are calling the functions correctly.  


### 3/4 - 3/10
**DEADLINES:**
* 3/4: Iteration 1 status report: Design and implement minimal viable system

**GOALS:**
1. Game play functions working correctly
2. Play level, clear the level data, then load the next level. Make sure this loop is working like it should.
3. Add undo move function
4. Add reset move function

### 3/11 - 3/17
SPRING BREAK!


### 3/18 - 3/24
**DEADLINES:**
* Monday 3/18 - Iteration 2 status report: Iteratively improve minimal viable system

**GOALS:**
1. Saving the game: save the level file list so they can start on the level they were on when the game is reloaded. Save progress on incomplete levels. 
2. Add more bottles, figure out if adjustments to grid container will be necessary as more bottles are added


### 3/25 - 3/31
**GOALS:**
1. Write status report 3
2. Add options to change difficulty level
    * Maybe have "easy", "medium", and "difficult" sets of levels to choose from?
3. Add increased difficulty option: hide the color on all blocks except the top block. After user moves top block, the color on the block that was beneath it will be exposed
4. Add level timer

### 4/1 - 4/7
**DEADLINES:**
* Monday 4/1 - Iteration 3 status report: Iteratively test and refine solution

**GOALS:**
1. Add animations when transferring color from one bottle to another
2. Background music and sound effects

### 4/8 - 4/14
**GOALS:**
1. Write report and prepare presentation
2. Complete any final adjustments


### 4/15 - 4/21
**DEADLINES:**
* Monday 4/15: Present and submit report of our completed project implementation
